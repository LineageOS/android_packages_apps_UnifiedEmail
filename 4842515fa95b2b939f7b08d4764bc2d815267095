      "message": "After having compared current version and version after your patch: What\u0027s the reason for changing the status bar color to be the same as toolbar color? Other apps (Contacts, Messaging,  Eleven, just to name a few, and various 3rd party apps as well) color the status bar darker than the toolbar, which is what the current version also does. Unless there\u0027s strong reasoning I think it should stay that way.",
