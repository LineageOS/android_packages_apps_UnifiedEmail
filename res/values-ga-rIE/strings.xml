  <!-- Content description for the attach button that appears in compose for tablet layouts.
         This is not to be confused with the menu items, this is an actual button in the layout.
         On v18 and below devices, this button is used to attach photos only and so the text
         is for adding a photo attachment. On v19, it is used to attach an arbitrary file
         and so this string is overridden to use the "attach file" text. The drawable used
         for this button is overridden similarly. -->
